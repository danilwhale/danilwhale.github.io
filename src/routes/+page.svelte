<p>i'm writing stuff with C# (rarely Java or C++) and games using OpenGL</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/danilwhale/sharpcraft">sharpcraft</a>
        <i>- mixed; yet another ancient Minecraft clone, made with C#</i>
        <ul>
            <li>sharpcraft - unsupported, c0.0.11a; was made when learning raylib, buggy and laggy</li>
            <li>sharpcraft-indev - archived, in-20100223; never saw the light of the day; made with raylib</li>
            <li>sharpcraft-2 - hiatus, in-20100223; clean room approach; made with OpenGL (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET">Silk.NET</a>) and SDL3 (<a href="https://github.com/ppy/SDL3-CS">ppy.SDL3-CS</a>)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/danilwhale/Raylib-cs.BleedingEdge">Raylib-cs.BleedingEdge</a>
        <i>- active; C# bindings for the master branch of <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib">raylib</a></i>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/danilwhale/SillyRendering">sillyrendering</a>
        <i>- unsupported; a Minecraft mod that makes your game renderer silly!</i>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/danilwhale/BuildingGame">building game</a>
        <i>- unsupported; a game where you can place tiles, made to learn raylib and C#, now it's just a relic of the past</i>
        <ul>
            <li>/main - buggy rewrite of the original branch</li>
            <li>/legacy - the original branch, a lot of obscure code</li>
            <li>/rewrite - the rewrite staging branch</li>
            <li>/definite-final-rewrite-edition - private; the rewrite I can update occasionally</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
